# 0.0 Abstract 
Music can be described as a series of waves and vibrations that propagate and reflect in a medium through time and space. For plants and animals, air is the most common medium sound travels through before tingling senses. Music varies widely across regions on Earth; empirically, sound can be fast, slow, loud, quiet, and society has engineered numerous manual and interactive devices that differ significantly in how they produce sound, modifying the geometry and amplitude of the resulting waves.



### Scientific definition of sound:
**"Music and sound impinge upon our body and our mind and we can react to both either positively or negatively. Much depends, in this regard, on the frequency spectrum and the level of the sound stimuli..." (Reybrouck et al.).**
